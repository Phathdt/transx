# transx

Wallet transfer system in Go — internal/external money transfers with an
auditable accounting ledger, event-driven processing, idempotent APIs, and
eventually consistent external settlement. See [`docs/prd.md`](docs/prd.md) for
the full product spec.

Each module under `internal/modules/<domain>/` follows a DDD split:

- `domain/` — entities and repository interfaces (no infra dependencies)
- `application/` — services (use cases) and DTOs
- `infrastructure/` — sqlc `gen/` code, `query/*.sql`, repository implementations

## Quick Start

Requires Go 1.26, Docker, and (for codegen) `sqlc` + `goose`.

### 1. Start infrastructure

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres redpanda   # Postgres + Redpanda (Kafka API)
```

Backend containers mount these local files read-only in Docker Compose:

- `backend/config.yaml` → `/app/config.yaml`
- `backend/.env` → `/app/.env`

This lets `auth` and `wallet` share the same local config and secrets while
still supporting env overrides like `POSTGRES__DATABASE_URL` and
`KAFKA__BROKERS`.

### 2. Apply migrations and seed dev data

```bash
cd backend
make migrate
make seed          # alice/bob/carol/dave/eve @transx.dev (password: password123)
                   # + wallet accounts for alice/bob (USD)
```

### 3. Run a service

The wallet workload is split across independent commands on the one `transx`
binary so each scales and deploys separately:

```bash
make run-wallet         # wallet: HTTP API only
make run-replayer       # outbox-replayer: drain outbox table to Kafka
make run-consumer       # consumer: transfer processor + provider + retries
make run-stub-provider  # stub-provider: fake payment provider (POST /submit)
go run . --config config.yaml auth   # auth service (ForwardAuth backend)
```

`consumer` and `outbox-replayer` need Redpanda up — Kafka is a hard dependency
and the process fails fast at startup if the brokers or topics are missing.
`wallet` (API only) and `auth` do not touch Kafka. `outbox-replayer` must stay
single-instance: the publisher holds no row lock, so ordering relies on exactly
one replayer running.

External transfers go through a pluggable provider reached over HTTP. The
bundled `stub-provider` is mode-driven via `PROVIDER__MODE` (`always_success` |
`always_failure` | `always_timeout`, default `always_success`) so the full
external lifecycle can be exercised without a real provider API; the `consumer`
reaches it at `PROVIDER__BASE_URL`.

### Full stack via Compose

```bash
docker compose up -d        # traefik + auth + wallet + outbox-replayer + consumer + stub-provider + postgres + redpanda
```

A Traefik gateway fronts the backend on `http://localhost:4000`. Login is
public; all other routes are gated by ForwardAuth, which verifies the bearer
token and injects `X-User-Id` onto the upstream request.

```bash
# Login (public)
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/v1/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"alice@transx.dev","password":"password123"}'

# Authenticated request (Traefik verifies the token, injects X-User-Id)
curl http://localhost:4000/api/v1/accounts/<id> -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

## Backend CLI

```
transx [--config|-c config.yaml] <subcommand>

  auth      Start the auth service (POST /login + ForwardAuth /check)
  wallet    Start the wallet HTTP API (API only; workers run separately)
  outbox-replayer
            Drain the wallet outbox table to Kafka (single instance)
  consumer  Process the transfer lifecycle (processor + provider + retries)
  stub-provider
            Run the stub payment provider HTTP service (POST /submit)
  seed      Insert development users and wallet accounts (idempotent)
  openapi-export
            Generate the merged OpenAPI spec without starting services
              --output | -o openapi.yaml   (default: openapi.yaml)
  migrate (m)  Database migrations
    up        Apply all pending migrations
    down      Rollback last migration
    status    Show migration status
```

## Common Commands

```bash
# Infrastructure
docker compose up -d postgres redpanda   # start dependencies
docker compose down                       # stop everything

# Run from backend/
make migrate        # apply goose migrations

make run-wallet         # wallet HTTP API
make run-replayer       # outbox-replayer

make run-stub-provider  # stub payment provider

# Code generation / quality

- **Gateway**: Traefik terminates routing and delegates authentication to the
  auth service via ForwardAuth.
- **Auth service**: issues JWTs (`POST /api/v1/login`) and verifies them for the
  gateway (`GET /api/v1/check`), echoing `X-User-Id` to upstream services.
- **Wallet workload** owns accounts, transfers, ledger entries, and the outbox
  (single consistency boundary for all money movement), split across independent
  commands on one binary so each scales/deploys on its own:
  - **`wallet`** (HTTP API only) stages a transfer plus an outbox event in one
    transaction and serves reads. It touches no Kafka.
  - **`outbox-replayer`** relays outbox events to Redpanda in FIFO order. It is
    single-instance (no row lock, so one publisher preserves ordering).
  - **`consumer`** processes the transfer lifecycle: internal P2P transfers move
    money in one transaction; external transfers add a reserve→submit→settle
    lifecycle where the provider consumer submits to the payment provider over
    HTTP and settles the outcome (success debits the hold, failure releases it).
  - **`stub-provider`** is the fake payment provider reached over HTTP.

## Wallet API

All routes are under `/api/v1` and gated by ForwardAuth (the gateway injects
`X-User-Id` after verifying the bearer token).

| Method | Path                      | Description                              |
| ------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/accounts`               | Create a wallet account for the caller   |
| `GET`  | `/accounts/{accountId}`   | Get an account balance (owner-scoped)    |
| `POST` | `/transfers`              | Create a transfer (idempotent)           |
| `GET`  | `/transfers/{transferId}` | Get a transfer (owner-scoped)            |

`POST /transfers` requires an `Idempotency-Key` header — a client-generated UUID
(uuidv7 recommended). Retrying with the same key replays the original transfer;
reusing it with a different body returns `409`. The transfer is created
`PENDING` and settled asynchronously, so poll `GET /transfers/{id}` for the
final `SUCCEEDED`/`FAILED` status.

`transferType` selects the flow. `INTERNAL` (default) moves funds to another
in-ledger account and requires `toAccountId`. `EXTERNAL` sends funds out through
the provider: omit `toAccountId` (there is no in-ledger destination) and the
`provider` is set from server config — clients never send it.

```bash
# Internal P2P transfer
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/v1/transfers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H 'Idempotency-Key: 0190bf3e-...' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"fromAccountId":"<a>","toAccountId":"<b>","amount":"100","currency":"USD","transferType":"INTERNAL"}'

# External transfer (no toAccountId)
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/v1/transfers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H 'Idempotency-Key: 0190bf3f-...' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"fromAccountId":"<a>","amount":"100","currency":"USD","transferType":"EXTERNAL"}'
```

Authorization is P2P: the `fromAccountId` must belong to the caller (otherwise
`403`); the destination may be anyone's. Reads are owner-scoped — another user's
account or transfer returns `404`. The full request/response schema is in the
generated `openapi.yaml` (`make openapi`).

    loop poll outbox
        PUB->>DB: SELECT pending outbox events
        PUB->>RP: publish transfer.requested
        PUB->>DB: mark PUBLISHED
    end

    PR->>RP: consume transfer.requested

    PR->>DB: BEGIN — lock accounts (ordered)<br/>debit from / credit to (if ACTIVE & funded)<br/>write ledger, status=SUCCEEDED<br/>+ outbox(transfer.completed) — COMMIT

    C->>API: GET /transfers/{id} (poll)
    API-->>C: status SUCCEEDED / FAILED
```

## External Transfer Flow

An external transfer leaves the system through a provider, so it cannot settle
in one transaction. It splits into reserve (hold funds) and settle (after the
provider responds), each its own transaction guarded by transfer status.

    actor C as Client

    API->>DB: INSERT transfer(PENDING) + outbox(transfer.requested)
    API-->>C: 202 { transferId, status: PENDING }

    PR->>DB: BEGIN — guard PENDING<br/>available → hold, ledger HOLD<br/>status=RESERVED + outbox(provider.requested) — COMMIT

    PC->>PV: Submit(transferId, amount, currency)
    alt provider SUCCESS
        PV-->>PC: { SUCCESS, referenceId }
        PC->>DB: BEGIN — guard RESERVED<br/>debit hold, ledger DEBIT<br/>status=SUCCEEDED + outbox(transfer.completed) — COMMIT
    else provider FAILURE
        PV-->>PC: { FAILURE, reason }
        PC->>DB: BEGIN — guard RESERVED<br/>release hold → available, ledger RELEASE<br/>status=FAILED + outbox(transfer.failed) — COMMIT
    else provider timeout (transient)
        PV-->>PC: error
        Note over PC: escalate retry tiers then DLQ,<br/>transfer stays RESERVED
    end

    C->>API: GET /transfers/{id} (poll)
    API-->>C: status SUCCEEDED / FAILED
```

## Worker Consumer Flow

Several background workers process transfers, split across the `outbox-replayer`
(the publisher) and `consumer` (processor, provider consumer, retry tiers)
commands. Within each command they run as goroutines supervised by an errgroup
so a fatal worker error brings the process down for a clean restart.

```

- **Outbox publisher** drains `outbox_events` in FIFO order and marks each
  `PUBLISHED` only after a successful publish (`WHERE status='PENDING'` guards
  against double-marking). A single publisher owns the table.
- **Transfer processor** (group `wallet-processor`) deduplicates via
  `inbox_events`, then routes by `transfer_type` read from the database.
  `INTERNAL` moves money in one transaction: it locks both accounts in a
  deterministic order (avoids cross deadlock), runs a conditional debit
  (`available_balance >= amount AND status='ACTIVE'`) and credit, writes the
  ledger, advances status, and stages the completion event — all atomically.
  `EXTERNAL` reserves a hold (`available → hold`, ledger `HOLD`), sets status
  `RESERVED`, and stages `transfer.provider.requested`.
- **Provider consumer** (group `wallet-provider`) consumes
  `transfer.provider.requested`, submits to the payment provider, and settles in
  one transaction: success debits the hold (ledger `DEBIT`, status `SUCCEEDED`),
  business failure releases it (ledger `RELEASE`, status `FAILED`). A provider
  timeout is treated as transient and retried through the tiers. Each settle step
  is guarded by the `RESERVED` status so a redelivery never double-settles.
- **Retries**: transient failures (serialization, deadlock, provider timeout)
  escalate through delayed-retry tiers (`6s` → `30s` → `5m`); poison messages and
  exhausted retries go to `transx.wallet.dlq`, so one bad message never wedges the
  partition. A timed-out external transfer stays `RESERVED` until it lands in the
  DLQ (provider reconciliation is out of scope for now).

## Idempotency

Two independent layers protect against duplicate money movement:

| Layer              | Mechanism                                                                                                                                                                                   | Location                                                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **API**            | Unique index `(user_id, idempotency_key)` + `request_hash` — same key & body replays the original transfer, different body returns `409`                                                    | `wallet/application/services/transfer_service.go`                       |
| **Kafka consumer** | `inbox_events` keyed on `(consumer_group, message_key)` — a redelivered message is skipped; the per-step status guard (`PENDING` for reserve/internal, `RESERVED` for settle) inside each transaction is the final double-spend defense. The two consumer groups (`wallet-processor`, `wallet-provider`) dedup in separate namespaces. | `wallet/infrastructure/processor`, `wallet/infrastructure/repositories` |

```

Modules use `application/dto` for transport-facing commands and responses,
`application/services` for business logic, `domain/entities` for
transport-agnostic domain objects, and `domain/interfaces` for ports and
repositories. Infrastructure implements those interfaces over sqlc-generated
queries.

Each service registers only its own routes — auth runs `RegisterRoutes`, wallet
runs `RegisterWalletRoutes` — so neither binary carries the other's handlers.
The OpenAPI exporter combines both groups with nil handlers
(`RegisterAllRoutesForSpec`) into a single merged `openapi.yaml`.

Conventions:

- **IDs are UUID v7** — DB columns default to `uuidv7()` (Postgres 18); let the
  DB assign them.
- **Money is `decimal.Decimal`** mapped to `NUMERIC(20,4)`; never floats.
- **Errors** return `*apperror.AppError` (carries HTTP status); `DomainErrorHandler`
  maps them to responses.
- **Config**: add fields to `internal/platform/config/config.go`; env override
  format is `SECTION__KEY` (e.g. `AUTH__JWT_SECRET`, `PROVIDER__MODE`). Secrets
  stay in `.env`.
- **Money never settles across a network call in one tx** — external transfers
  reserve a hold first, then settle in a second transaction after the provider
  responds, so a mid-flight failure leaves funds held rather than lost.
